# Setup
To get started vDefiant Math Engine is a header driven ME. To utilize the math library all that is needed are the proper header files on what is wanted. The headers are specifically in a file called vd1m and can be included via ```cpp <vd1m/..>```. More specifically are examples given below of both global definition headers as well as explicit headers:

- Global:
```cpp
#include <vd1m/vd1m.hpp>
#include <vd1m/ext/..>
```
- Explicit:
```cpp
#include <vd1m/Mat2.hpp>
#include <vd1m/Vec3.hpp>
#include <vd1m/ext/Mat3_scale>
```
