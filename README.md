# Setup
To use vDefiant1.0 Math Engine, all that is required is the including of the headers. In this case, headers may be included by a global header, or by the use of specific headers. I.e :
- Global definintion:
```
#include <vd1m/vd1m.hpp>
```
- Specific:
```
#include <vd1m/Mat2.hpp>
#include <vd1m/Vec3.hpp>
```
